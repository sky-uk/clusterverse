Full-lifecycle, immutable cloud infrastructure cluster management, using Ansible.
- **Multi-cloud:** clusterverse can manage cluster lifecycle in AWS and GCP
- **Deploy:**  You define your infrastructure as code (in Ansible yaml), and clusterverse will deploy it 
- **Scale (e.g. add a node):**  If you change the config yaml and rerun the deploy, new nodes will be added.
- **Redeploy (e.g. up-version):** If you need to up-version, the `redelpoy` playbook will replace each node in turn, (with optional callbacks), and rollback if any failures occur. 

**clusterverse** is designed to deploy base-vm infrastructure that underpins cluster-based infrastructure, for example, Couchbase, or Cassandra.

Contributions are welcome and encouraged.  Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sky-uk/clusterverse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Requirements

### Python dependencies
Dependencies are managed via Pipenv:
+ `pipenv install`  will create a Python virtual environment with dependencies specified in the Pipfile

To active the pipenv:
+ `pipenv shell`
+ or prepend the ansible-playbook commands with: `pipenv run`

### AWS
- AWS account with IAM rights to create EC2 VMs + Security Groups in the chosen VPC/Subnets
- Already created VPCs
- Already created Subnets

### GCP
- Create a gcloud account.
- Create a service account in `IAM & Admin` / `Service Accounts`.  Download the json file locally.  This file is used in the `GCP_CREDENTIALS` environment variable that is read in `group_vars/all/clusters.yml`.  You need to export this variable (e.g. `export GCP_CREDENTIALS=/home/<user>/src/gcp.json`).
- Google Cloud SDK need to be installed to run gcloud command-line (e.g. to enable delete protection) - this is handled by `pipenv install`

### DNS
DNS is optional.  If unset, no DNS names will be created.  If required, you will need a DNS Zone delegated to one of the following:
- Bind9
- Route53

Credentials to the DNS server will also be required. 

### Cloud credential management
Credentials can be encrypted inline in the playbooks using [ansible-vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html).
+ Because multiple environments are supported, it is recommended to use [vault-ids](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html#multiple-vault-passwords), and have credentials per environment (e.g. to help avoid accidentally running a deploy on prod).
+ There is a small script (`.vaultpass-client.py`) that returns a password stored in an environment variable (`VAULT_PASSWORD_BUILDENV`) to ansible.  This is particularly useful for running under Jenkins.
  + `export VAULT_PASSWORD_BUILDENV=<'dev/stage/prod' password>`
+ To encrypt (export `VAULT_PASSWORD_BUILDENV` first):
  + `ansible-vault encrypt_string --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py --encrypt-vault-id=sandbox`
+ To decrypt, either run the playbook with the correct `VAULT_PASSWORD_BUILDENV` and just `debug: msg=` the variable, or:
  + `echo '$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.2;AES256;sandbox`
  `86338616...33630313034' | ansible-vault decrypt --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py`  + or, to decrypt using a non-exported password:
  + `echo '$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.2;AES256;sandbox`
  `86338616...33630313034' | ansible-vault decrypt --ask-vault-pass`


### Cluster Variables
The clusters are defined as code, within Ansible yaml file as below:

#### group_vars/\<clusterid\>/cluster_vars.yml:
```
buildenv: ""                      # The environment (dev, stage, etc), which must be an attribute of cluster_vars
release_version: ""               # Identifies the application version that is being deployed (optional)
app_name: "nginx"                 # The name of the application cluster (e.g. 'couchbase', 'nginx'); becomes part of cluster_name.
app_class: "webserver"            # The class of application (e.g. 'database', 'webserver'); becomes part of the fqdn

cluster_vars:
  <buildenv>:
    ...
    hosttype_vars:
      <hosttype>: {...}
```

#### group_vars/\<clusterid\>/cluster_vars.yml:
Contains your application-specific variables

## Invocation examples: _deploy_
The `cluster.yml` playbook deploys a cluster from the config defined above.

### AWS:
```
ansible-playbook -u ubuntu --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> cluster.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_aws_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py
ansible-playbook -u ubuntu --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> cluster.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_aws_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py --tags=clusterverse_clean -e clean=true -e release_version=v1.0.1
ansible-playbook -u ubuntu --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> cluster.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_aws_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py -e clean=true -e skip_package_upgrade=true -e release_version=v1.0.1
```
### GCP:
```
ansible-playbook -u <username> --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> cluster.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_gce_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py
ansible-playbook -u <username> --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> cluster.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_gce_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py --tags=clusterverse_clean -e clean=true
ansible-playbook -u <username> --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> cluster.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_gce_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py -e clean=true -e skip_package_upgrade=true
```

### Mandatory command-line variables:
+ `-e clusterid=<vtp_aws_euw1>` - A directory named `clusterid` must be present in `group_vars`.  Holds the parameters that define the cluster; enables a multi-tenanted repository.
+ `-e buildenv=<sandbox>` - The environment (dev, stage, etc), which must be an attribute of `cluster_vars` defined in `group_vars/<clusterid>/cluster_vars.yml`

### Optional extra variables:
+ `-e app_name=<nginx>` - Normally defined in `group_vars/<clusterid>/cluster_vars.yml`.  The name of the application cluster (e.g. 'couchbase', 'nginx'); becomes part of cluster_name
+ `-e app_class=<proxy>` - Normally defined in `group_vars/<clusterid>/cluster_vars.yml`.  The class of application (e.g. 'database', 'webserver'); becomes part of the fqdn
+ `-e release_version=<v1.0.1>` - Identifies the application version that is being deployed.
+ `-e dns_tld_external=<test.example.com>` - Normally defined in `group_vars/<clusterid>/cluster_vars.yml`.
+ `-e clean=true` - Deletes all existing VMs and security groups before creating
+ `-e skip_package_upgrade=true` - Does not upgrade the OS packages (saves a lot of time during debugging)
+ `-e reboot_on_package_upgrade=true` - After updating packages, performs a reboot on all nodes.
+ `-e prometheus_node_exporter_install=false` - Does not install the prometheus node_exporter
+ `-e static_journal=true` - Creates /var/log/journal directory, which will keep a permanent record of journald logs in systemd machines (normally ephemeral)
+ `-e filebeat_install=false` - Does not install filebeat
+ `-e create_gce_network=true` - Create GCP network and subnetwork (probably needed if creating from scratch and using public network)

### Tags
- clusterverse_clean: Deletes all VMs and security groups (also needs `-e clean=true` on command line)
- clusterverse_create: Creates only EC2 VMs, based on the hosttype_vars values in group_vars/all/cluster.yml
- clusterverse_config: Updates packages, sets hostname, adds hosts to DNS

## Invocation examples: _redeploy_
The `redeploy.yml` playbook will completely redeploy the cluster; this is useful for example to upgrade the underlying operating system version.

### AWS:
```
ansible-playbook -u ubuntu --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> redeploy.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_aws_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py
```
### GCP:
```
ansible-playbook -u <username> --private-key=/home/<user>/.ssh/<rsa key> redeploy.yml -e buildenv=sandbox -e clusterid=vtp_gce_euw1 --vault-id=sandbox@.vaultpass-client.py
```

### Mandatory command-line variables:
+ `-e clusterid=<vtp_aws_euw1>` - A directory named `clusterid` must be present in `group_vars`.  Holds the parameters that define the cluster; enables a multi-tenanted repository.
+ `-e buildenv=<sandbox>` - The environment (dev, stage, etc), which must be an attribute of `cluster_vars` defined in `group_vars/<clusterid>/cluster_vars.yml`

### Extra variables:
+ `-e 'redeploy_scheme'=<subrole_name>` - The scheme corresponds to one defined in 
+ `-e canary=['start', 'finish', 'none']` - Specify whether to start or finish a canary deploy, or 'none' deploy
+ `-e myhosttypes="master,slave"`- In redeployment you can define which host type you like to redeploy. If not defined it will redeploy all host types


The redeploy playbook supports pluggable infrastructure redeployment schemes.  Two are provided:
+ It contains callback hooks:
  + `mainclusteryml`: This is the name of the deployment playbook.
  + `predeleterole`: This is the name of a role that should be called prior to deleting a VM

### _scheme_rmvm_rmdisks_only
This scheme runs a very basic rolling redeployment of the cluster.
+ For each node in the cluster, delete it, then run the main cluster.yml, which forces the missing node to be redeployed.  Run with the same parameters as for the main playbook.
+ **This assumes a resilient deployment (it can tolerate one node being removed from the cluster).**

### _scheme_addnewvm_rmdisk_rollback
This scheme runs a more advanced rolling redeployment of the cluster.
+ For each VM, firstly, a new VM is created, and then the old one is shut down.
+ If the process proceeds correctly for all the VMs, the old (now shut-down) VMs, are terminated
+ If the process fails for any reason, the old VMs are reinstated.
